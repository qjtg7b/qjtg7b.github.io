<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
<h2>Here is some information about my hometown.</h2>
<p> I was born in St. Louis, but I live in the suburb of St. Charles, Missouri. It is located about 25 minutes west of downtown STL. It has a population of about 66,000 people. It is known for its historic downtown location, which features a museum about the Lewis and Clark expedition. Lindenwood University, known for its hockey program, is located in St. Charles.
